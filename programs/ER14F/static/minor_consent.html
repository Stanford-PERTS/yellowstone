        <p>What will happen to me in this study? (Description of the study)</p>
        <p>

            During the study, we’ll ask you to tell us what you think about
            school, learning, and yourself. You’ll have the opportunity to
            participate in an online program that will involve writing about
            yourself, completing some questions, and/or learning about
            emotions. We will also ask your teachers some questions about you.
            This will include getting your grades and data about your behavior
            in class.

        <p>Can anything bad happen to me? (Risks or Discomforts of Participating)</p>
        <p>Nope; everything you’ll be doing will be completely safe.</p>

        <p>Can anything good happen to me? (Benefits of Participating)</p>
        <p>

            Hopefully, you’ll find the program interesting. Also, you will help
            us learn more about what students think, how they learn, and how
            they feel in school. This information will be used to help make
            school a better place for all students.

        <p>Who will know I am in the study? (Confidentiality)</p>
        <p>

            Your parents, your teachers, the other students in the study, and
            the researchers at Stanford who are in charge of the study will
            know that you’re in it. The researchers at Stanford will know how
            you respond to the questions we ask you. Your teachers will know
            how you respond to some of the questions, and we will always tell
            you which questions your teachers will be able to see.

        <p>What if I do not want to do this? (Voluntary Participation)</p>
        <p>

            You don’t have to participate. We hope that you will enjoy
            participating, but you can stop at any time. Just tell your teacher
            that you don’t want to continue in the study, and you won’t have
            to.
