<h1>Data Submission Instructions</h1>

<p>
    Thank you again for agreeing to coordinate this program at your school!
    Below are instructions for the data submission process. If your schoolâ€™s
    data will be provided by someone other than yourself, please connect your
    PERTS Coordinator with the correct person.
</p>

<h2>Important Note</h2>
<p>
    <b>Please DO NOT send any student data via email!</b> In order to provide the
    highest level of security for confidential student data, all data must be
    uploaded to a secure website. The link for uploading data is provided
    below.
</p>

<h2>General Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Formatting your Data:</strong> Our preference is to receive
        data as a single csv file. If you would like a sample template, please
        let your PERTS coordinator know.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Uploading your data:</strong> 
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Create a Box.com accout:</strong> You will be uploading
                your data to a secure folder on Box.com. If you do not have a
                Box account already, you will need to create one. It is free
                and simple to create a personal account. You will only need to
                provide your email address, a password, and a phone number.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Upload your file:</strong> When you are ready to submit
                your data, click the following link and select &ldquo;Upload&rdquo;.

                    High School Transition Program Data Folder
                </b></a>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Notify your PERTS coordinator once your data has been uploaded:</strong> 
        Please email your coordinator to let them know once you have
        successfully uploaded your data.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>When to submit data:</strong> Please provide student data as
        soon as it becomes available at the end of the semester.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Provide Data For Which Students</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Ideally:</strong> We would like academic records for all
        students in your school. This will allow us to compare students in the
        program to those that were not so that we can perform a more powerful
        analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Minimally:</strong> We will need academic records from those
        students who participated in the program. We can provide a list of
        these students if necessary.
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>What Data To Provide</h2>
<p>At the end of the semester, please provide the following data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>

            <li>Special education status</li>
            <li>English language learner status</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Performance data from Academic year 2013-2014, Fall 2014, and Spring
        2015 (when it becomes available):
        <ul>
           <li>Class grades by semester (for all classes taken by each student)</li>
           <li>Standardized exam results (if available)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Absences (either by class or total)
    </li>
    <li>
        Tardies (either by class or total)

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3><b>How long will the data collection process take?</b></h3>
<p>
    The process of compiling and submitting your students' data typically takes
    about 1 to 1.5 hours. If it seems as though it will take longer, please
    speak with your PERTS coordinator to see if we can suggest ways to
    streamline the process.
</p>
<h3><b>Is it okay to provide separate files for grades and other data?</b></h3>
<p>Yes, this is fine.</p>
<h3><b>I won't be the one providing you with data. Is that okay?</b></h3>
<p>
    Yes, this is fine. Please provide us with the contact information of the
    person who will provide data prior to the beginning of the study. This
    will allow us to make sure they are clear on the timeline and on what they
    will need to provide.
</p>
<h3><b>What kind of suspension and/or discipline data should I provide?</b></h3>
<p>
    Whatever your school's system is for suspensions (for example, in-school
    versus at-home) and other disciplinary actions (for example, detensions)
    will be fine. You can provide a description of abbreviations used if
    necessary.
