        <p>What will happen to me in this study? (Description of the study)</p>
        <p>

            During the study, we'll ask you to tell us what you think about school, learning, and yourself. You'll have the opportunity to participate in an online program that will involve writing about yourself, completing some questions, and/or learning how you can study more effectively. We may also ask your teachers some questions about you.

        <p>Can anything bad happen to me? (Risks or Discomforts of Participating)</p>
        <p>Nope; everything you'll be doing will be completely safe.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Can anything good happen to me? (Benefits of Participating)</p>
        <p>

            Hopefully, you'll find the program interesting. Also, you will help us learn more about what students think and how they learn. This information will be used to help make school a better place for all students to learn.

        <p>Who will know I am in the study? (Confidentiality)</p>
        <p>

            Your parents, your teachers, the other students in your class and the researchers at Stanford who are in charge of the study will know that you're in it. The researchers at Stanford will know how you respond to the questions we ask you. Your teachers may be told how you respond to some of the questions, and we will always tell you which questions your teachers will be able to see.

            Do I have to participate? You don't have to participate. We hope that you will enjoy participating, but you can stop at any time. Just tell your teacher that you don't want to continue in the study, and you won't have to.

            <p>How will you store data to protect confidentiality?</p>
            <p>
                All confidential data we receive will be digital and will be kept in electronic spreadsheets stored in encrypted folders on study staff password-protected computers or in password-protected databases. When we receive confidential data it is immediately stripped of identifiable information. For example, name are replaced with a unique identification number. Identifiable data will not be shared with anyone outside the trained research team.  All confidential data will be deleted when no longer needed for the purposes for which the study was conducted. 
            </p>

    <li>
        <p>How will results be used?</p>

        <p>
            After we finish our project, we will write reports describing what we have learned from working with you and your classmates. All your information will remain strictly confidential. We will present the aggregate (whole school) data to your teacher and principal as well as to the broader research community.
