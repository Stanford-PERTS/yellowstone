            <h2>The benefits for teachers</h2>
              <p>
               The Engagement Project is designed to help teachers create a more
               engaging and more equitable classroom climate. The process
               consists of multiple cycles of inquiry and action.
            </p>
            <p>
              Teachers use brief students surveys to develop insights into the
              quality and equity of students’ learning experiences. Teachers
              receive customized reports that recommend evidence-based
              strategies relevant to their students. These steps are repeated
              to improve classroom climate and motivation.
          </p>
          <p>
              The Engagement Project allows <u>teachers</u> to:
          </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Use brief surveys to collect data on their
                  students’ experience in class
                </li>
                <li>
                  Gain access to an online library of evidence-based
                  strategies developed by educators for boosting engagement
                  and motivation
                </li>
                <li>
                  Receive reports showing change over time so that they
                  can see if new strategies they try are having an impact
                </li>
                <li>
                 Work collaboratively with their colleagues to boost learning
                by leveraging their collective wisdom

            The Engagement Project is more effective and fulfilling when it&rsquo;s
            collaborative. Ideally, teachers work on an &ldquo;engagement team&rdquo; of
            3-8 teachers. Teachers can play one of two roles on an engagement
            team:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Team Captain</strong> - The team captain creates a new
              team and invites their colleagues to join them. The captain
              acts as the main organizer for the team. If you’re going to
              participate by yourself, you’re going to be the team captain by
              default.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Team Member</strong> - Team members join a team after
              receiving an invitation from a team captain. They fully
              participate in all of the activities, but they do not have the
              same administrative responsibilities as the team captain. Lucky
              them!
