          <div id="what-are-learning-conditions" class="subgroup">
            <h4>What are learning conditions?</h4>
            <p>
              Research shows that many conditions affect students&rsquo; desire
              and ability to learn. When deciding which learning conditions to
              focus on, PERTS considers several factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Is there scientific evidence that the learning condition
                affects learning?</strong> The condition must have a
                well-established relationship to student success.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Can educators directly influence the learning condition?
                </strong>Many conditions affect whether students can learn
                effectively. Some of those conditions, like hunger and sleep
                deprivation, can be difficult for educators to directly
                influence. Other learning conditions, meanwhile, are very much
                within educators&rsquo; sphere of influence. For example,
                educators&rsquo; decisions affect whether students get the
                frequent, specific feedback they need to quickly improve their
                understanding, whether students feel like they belong in class,
                or whether students believe they can be successful in class.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div

            <h4>How do learning conditions impact student achievement?</h4>
            <p>
              In a <a href="/creating-learning-conditions">2019 study</a>,
              students who experienced positive learning conditions in a class
              were 30% more likely to earn an A or B in that class, and those
              benefits were pronounced for students of color. For example,
              Black males who experienced positive learning conditions were
              almost 2x more likely to earn an A or B than those who did not.
            </p>
            <p>
              Better learning conditions also led to better social and
              emotional learning outcomes. When learning conditions improved,
              students were 86% more likely to experience a higher sense of
              belonging, 24% more likely to develop a growth mindset, and 2x
              more likely to report they “tried their very best” in class.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div id="why-measure-learning-conditions" class="subgroup">
            <h4>Why measure learning conditions?</h4>
            <p>
              Even when educators recognize that specific learning conditions
              are important for student success&mdash;and even when educators
              try their best to create these conditions&mdash;doing so can be
              challenging. One of the main barriers is that, often, the messages
              educators intend to send are not the messages students receive.
              In other words, there&rsquo;s often a big gap between
              educators&rsquo; intentions and students&rsquo; experiences.
              Absent feedback from students, it can be very hard to recognize or
              close that gap.
            </p>
            <p>
              Copilot makes it easy for educators to collect student feedback
              using validated measures. It also provides for confidentiality so
              that students are comfortable being honest.
            </p>

          <div id="how-measure-learning-conditions" class="subgroup">
            <h4>How does Copilot measure learning conditions?</h4>
            <p>
              Students are asked to complete a survey with carefully designed
              questions that have been developed and tested by leading
              researchers. The questions help educators identify how
              students&rsquo; experiences in the classroom could be supporting
              or getting in the way of learning. This enables educators to take
              targeted actions to influence these experiences and, thereby,
              improve learning conditions over time.

              Copilot programs are designed for distinct audiences and vary
              slightly in the learning conditions they can measure. You can
              read a brief summary of measures available for each program and
              sample survey questions:

            <h4>How can I improve learning conditions?</h4>
            <p>
              The first step is to listen to students about what learning
              conditions they are experiencing. Once you have a sense of what
              conditions you want to improve, the
              <a href="https://equitablelearning.org">Equitable Learning
              Library</a> provides resources and recommendations that can be
              used to improve the quality and equity of the conditions students
              experience. Resources are organized into “books” representing
              each <a
                href="#what-are-the-learning-conditions-measured-in-copilot"
              >learning condition</a> and contain “chapters” that represent
              distinct strategies. “Chapters” include resources accessible to
              educators with different levels of expertise. For example,
              resources may include frameworks geared at providing educators
              with a richer understanding of a learning condition. They may
              also include concrete activities that educators can apply in
              their classrooms.

              Fostering student success is less like turning on a light switch,
              and more like growing a garden. It&rsquo;s a developmental process
              that takes time and is influenced by multiple factors:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Time Course</strong>: Effective learning is a collection
                of behaviors that depends on abilities and habits that take time
                to develop. For example, even if a student decides to study
                more, it might take her time to realize that she has to start
                going to the library after school instead of going back to a
                distracting home environment. Therefore, even if a student is
                more inclined to be engaged, it might take time for those
                desires to translate into the habits and study skills that are
                markers of effective learning. Give it time.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Multiple Determinants</strong>: Creating hospitable
                conditions for learning is like cultivating a garden: water,
                sunlight, and a variety of nutrients are each necessary but
                insufficient for all plants to grow optimally. Successful
                gardeners do not simply focus on providing sufficient water or
                providing sufficient sunlight; they attend carefully to each of
                those conditions with respect to the needs of each of their
                plants. Furthermore, they are especially mindful of the special
                care certain plants might need, e.g., because of prior neglect.
                In the same way, we suggest you work systematically over time to
                establish multiple hospitable learning conditions.

            <p>
              Copilot is an advanced professional learning platform that helps
              educators create supportive and equitable conditions for learning.
              Copilot enables educators to get rapid feedback from their
              students about how they are experiencing key learning conditions.
              Pilot data suggests that Copilot helps educators systematically
              improve learning conditions and that better learning conditions
              promote higher and more equitable academic achievement.

            <h4>Can I use Copilot remotely?</h4>
            <p>
              Absolutely! When teachers can’t see their students’ nonverbal
              cues, it’s much harder to understand what’s connecting with
              students and what isn’t. This is one of the many ways the
              COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult to help students
              stay motivated and learn.
            </p>
            <p>
              PERTS developed Copilot because we know that understanding
              students’ needs and experiences is essential for meeting students
              where they are and for supporting them—whether in the classroom
              or over a call. Though already a web-based platform, we’ve made
              enhancement to Copilot to ensure educators can seamlessly
              implement Copilot remotely. We also created an <a

              through the steps involved in implementing a Copilot program. For
              example, a project enables you to access learning modules, set
              survey dates, obtain survey instructions, and see reports.
            </p>
            <p> 
              Most educators work on a project alone or in collaboration with a
              handful of colleagues at the same school or college. Large-scale
              implementations usually benefit from setting up multiple separate
              projects. Contact us at
              <a href="</a> if you’d
              like to use Copilot with more than 10 educators so that we can

            <h4>What is a cycle?</h4>
            <p>
              It takes significant skill and persistence to create a supportive
              and equitable learning environment that enables all students to
              reach their potential. To master that complex skill, educators
              need ongoing feedback and practice. That&rsquo;s why Copilot
              programs are organized around multiple cycles of inquiry and
              action.
            </p>
            <p>
              In each cycle, educators start by collecting feedback from their
              students through a student survey. Then educators can reflect and
              investigate to create an action plan. Educators then apply their
              action plan and test strategies and practices that can improve
              student experiences. In the next cycle, educators use the survey
              to see if the strategies and practices were successful and to
              continue to make adjustments to their practice. Cycles typically
              last 2-6 weeks, depending on the preferences of the educators
              using Copilot.

            <h4>What is a roster?</h4>
            <p>
              A “roster” is just a list of students that is expected to
              participate in Copilot surveys. Most educators create a roster
              for each of their classes, but you can also have a single roster
              for all of your students.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once a roster is created in a project it cannot be moved to
              another project.

            <h4>What can I use as a Roster ID?</h4>
            <p>
              PERTS strongly recommends that you use students&rsquo; school
              email addresses as their Roster IDs. This will make it easier for
              students to remember their Roster ID, and it will prevent ID
              collisions (where two students inadvertently use the same ID,
              resulting in their responses overwriting each other).
            </p>
            <p>
              If you would like to use anything other than a school email
              address as the Roster ID, please contact <a

              the suitability of the alternate Roster ID. As per our strict

              Generally, Copilot will prompt you to create rosters when it is
              time to do so. You can also create or update your rosters at any

              Copilot surveys periodically ask students a few additional
              questions. Some of these questions enable us to
              <a href="#how-disaggregate">disaggregate data</a>
              in different ways (e.g., to show educators whether male and
              female students experience a learning environment differently).
              To keep the surveys short, these questions are only asked
              periodically or only from random subsets of students. These
              questions may inquire about students’ race, gender, prior grades,
              learning mindsets, comfort answering questions honestly, level of
              effort in a given class, perceptions of their teachers’ mindsets,
              and other similar factors. You can always

              the survey on a different day.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Debrief the survey results.</strong> In order to get
              authentic feedback from your students consistently, students need
              to trust that their responses are being taken to heart.
              Intentionally debriefing your reflections with students can
              contribute to cultivating that trust&mdash;it demonstrates to
              students that you value their voice and care about their learning
              experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are a few suggestions to engage students in this type of
              dialogue:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Demonstrate to your students that you’re listening by sharing
                back what you learned. Of course, you don’t have to share the
                actual reports or even specific figures with students. But you
                can share with them where you’re doing well and what you’re
                working to improve based on the feedback you received.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dig deeper with students through class discussions or
                interviews.

            <h4>What about survey fatigue?</h4>
            <p>
              Students get fatigued by surveys that are long and repetitive.
              They also grow tired of answering questions if no one acknowledges
              their responses or addresses their concerns. Unfortunately, many
              school surveys are designed without regard to students&rsquo; or
              teachers&rsquo; experiences, and we (at PERTS) find that
              troubling.
            </p>
            <p>
              We would be frustrated if someone asked our opinion over and over
              in five different ways and then gave no indication that anything
              meaningful would change as a result of our answers. We empathize
              with the students and with the educators who are sometimes
              required to take, or to administer, less-than-useful surveys.
            </p>
            <p>
              In sharp contrast, we designed our surveys to be part of an
              empowering process that elevates student voice and provides
              educators with rapid insights that they can act on immediately.
              Unlike many other surveys, Copilot surveys:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Are short.</strong> Surveys take students less than 10
                minutes to complete, or less if certain questions are turned
                off.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Elevate student voice in shaping their classroom
                experience.</strong> Our programs provide guidance to educators
                concerning how to frame the surveys to their students. When
                educators follow this guidance, it ensures their students
                understand that their opinions are valued and that their
                responses will influence what happens in class.

            <p>
              Survey reports prominently flag problems with student buy-in. For
              example, they show if students are not comfortable being honest
              or if they do not believe an educator will use the feedback to
              improve. If an educator is struggling to get high student buy-in,
              we recommend trying some of these strategies to support them:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Visit the educator&rsquo;s classroom to see how they are framing
                the surveys to students.
              </li>
              <li>
                Work with the educator, as needed, to create a plan for
                improving student buy-in. You can reference

            <h4>Why are survey results disaggregated?</h4>
            <p>
              In our school system&mdash;and in society more
              generally&mdash;systematic disparities exist between the
              opportunities afforded to members of different groups.
              Disparities in opportunity are especially pronounced by race,
              gender, and socioeconomic status. For example, Black, Latinx,
              Native American, and Pacific Islander students are less likely to
              receive the support they need to reach high academic standards.
              Copilot reports help educators compare the experiences of members
              of different groups so that, if significant disparities exist,
              educators can take additional steps to understand and mitigate
              those disparities.

            <h4>How does Copilot disaggregate survey results?</h4>
            <p>
              By default, Copilot reports disaggregate student experience data
              by gender and by  <a
              href="#race-grouping">race-ethnicity group membership</a>. Certain
              Copilot programs also disaggregate results by financial stress,
              while others enable educators to create a custom
              <a href="#what-is-target-group">target group</a>.

            <p>
              The first time that students complete a Copilot survey, they are
              asked what racial and ethnic groups they identify with. Our
              priority in asking students to identify their racial and ethnic
              background is to (1) help educators understand how students from
              structurally disadvantaged groups are experiencing the educational
              environment; and (2) to provide students from all racial, ethnic,
              and nationality backgrounds the chance to select at least one
              option that closely matches their self-identification and lived
              experience. In doing this, we recognize that the experiences of
              sub-populations within large race and ethnicity categories may be
              meaningfully different from one another and that it is important
              to reflect to students an understanding of this diversity, rather
              than forcing them to identify with broad categories that may not
              resonate well with their lived experiences. For these reasons,
              Copilot survey inquires about race and ethnic group members using
              the following question.
            </p>

            <h4>Why are race data grouped in reports?</h4>
            <p>
              When students self-identify their race and ethnicity in Copilot
              surveys, they can choose from 17 different categories and identify
              with multiple races (see <a href="#how-race-ethnicity">How are
              race-ethnicity data collected?</a>). However, results in reports
              are not broken out by those fine-grained categories because that
              level of disaggregation would make it impossible to maintain the
              confidentiality of students&rsquo; responses. (To maintain
              <a href="#student-privacy">students&rsquo; privacy</a>, Copilot
              reports only show results for a given group when that group has at
              least five members. That means, for example, that reports could
              not show results from Native American students if there were fewer
              than five Native American students on a given roster.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though we cannot break out data by each distinct race and
              ethnicity for privacy reasons, we believe it is important to
              give educators insight into whether students&rsquo; experiences in
              their classrooms are reinforcing or interrupting the nationally
              observed disparities in educational opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a compromise between the need to maintain student
              confidentiality and the desire to provide teachers with
              disaggregated data about opportunity gaps, Copilot reports
              group together certain races and ethnicities. Using national
              statistics on disparities in academic and disciplinary outcomes
              as a guide, reports group together students who self-identify as
              Black, Latinx, Native American, and/or Pacific Islander. Reports
              contrast their experiences to those of White and Asian students
              (who are comparatively advantaged according to the same national
              statistics).
            </p>
            <p>
              This compromise enables educators to get some insight about
              opportunity gaps in their classrooms while simultaneously
              protecting student confidentiality. In order to support more fine
              grained analysis, certain Copilot programs enable educators to
              create a custom <a href="#what-is-target-group">target
              group</a> that more accurately represents the groups of students
              in their local context who are situated farthest from
              opportunity.

            <p>
              In many schools and colleges, specific groups of students are
              situated further from opportunity. Often, these students are
              members of specific racial, ethnic, or gender groups; English
              language learners; or students who are members of multiple
              intersecting demographics (for example, men of color). If
              educators are aware that a specific group of students is situated
              further from opportunity in their context and want to
              disaggregate their results separately to better attend to their
              experiences, we encourage them to use the &ldquo;target
              group&rdquo; feature in Copilot to define a custom target group
              that specifically includes those students. The target group
              feature is intended to help educators adopt a <a
              href="https://haasinstitute.berkeley.edu/targeteduniversalism">Targeted
              Universalist</a> approach towards creating a more supportive and
              equitable learning environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a target group is set, reports will display results
              separately for students in the target group and for those who are
              not. This enables educators to see whether members of the target
              group experience their classroom differently. In this way,
              educators can recognize whether and how students&rsquo;
              experiences in their own classes may be reinforcing&mdash;or
              mitigating&mdash;the opportunity gaps observed in other data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: the target group feature is only available in

            <p>
              To protect <strong>educator privacy</strong>, each roster entered
              into Copilot has a main contact who receives survey instructions
              and reports for that roster. <strong>The only person in a Copilot
              project who can see a roster&rsquo;s reports is the main contact
              of that roster</strong>. PERTS encourages project members to share
              and discuss their reports with colleagues in order to get advice
              and share insights to the extent they feel comfortable doing so.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: it is possible for the project lead to
              change the main contact setting for a roster. This means that
              project lead Alice could, in theory, change the main contact of
              Bob&rsquo;s roster to be Alice herself, which would allow Alice to
              see Bob&rsquo;s reports. However, in that event, Bob would get an
              automated email informing him that Alice changed his roster
              settings.

            <p>
              We take student privacy extremely seriously both because it’s the
              law, and also because it’s the right thing to do! Our technical
              security measures are described at
              <a href="/security">perts.net/security</a>, and our
              legally-binding privacy policy can be found at
              <a href="/privacy">perts.net/privacy</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our strict privacy policy is specifically designed to meet the
              requirements spelled out in the Family Educational Rights and
              Privacy Act (FERPA), and hundreds of schools and colleges around
              the United States have implemented PERTS programs under the legal
              coverage provided by our privacy policy. Under the
              <a
                href="https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/sites/default/files/resource_document/file/FERPA%20Exceptions_HANDOUT_horizontal_0_0.pdf"
              >&ldquo;school official&rdquo;</a> exemption in FERPA, schools
              can share identifiable information with an individual or
              organization that is acting in the capacity of a school official.
              To qualify as a school official under FERPA, the individual or
              organization must be acting on behalf of the school, must keep
              the information confidential, must only use that information for
              the purposes approved by the school, and must enable the school
              to control that information. For example, the school must be
              allowed to review, change, or delete the personal information.
              Under no circumstance can the information be shared with third
              parties without the schools’ permission. The PERTS privacy policy
              meets all of those requirements. Check it out at

            <p>
              We generally do not share individual students’ responses (with
              the exception of open ended responses) because doing so could
              incentivize students to be dishonest and destroy the integrity of
              the process. Of course, we encourage you to have authentic and
              transparent face-to-face conversations with your students, but
              one of the objectives of Copilot surveys is to give you an easy,
              confidential way to get honest feedback.

          <div id="irb-approval" class="subgroup">
            <h4>Do I need IRB approval?</h4>
            <p>
              Schools and colleges have different rules about when an
              Institutional Review Board (IRB) needs to review and approve an
              activity. Typically, IRBs only need to review formal research
              activities that are intended to result in generalizable
              knowledge. In contrast, IRBs typically do not need to review
              quality improvement activities—activities that are intended to
              support an organization in improving its own practices and
              processes. Copilot programs are intended to help educators
              collect and use information for quality improvement purposes;
              therefore, IRB permission should not be required under most
              circumstances. However, if you intend to use the information you
              collect for formal research purposes, then you likely do need IRB
              approval. Also, some schools and colleges may ask IRBs to review
              quality improvement activities.

            <p>
              Copilot programs are designed to give an individual educator or
              small team of educators everything they need to improve the
              quality and equity of students’ learning experiences. However,
              when a school or college wants to use Copilot on a large scale,
              certain additional features and services can be quite helpful.
              For example:
            </p>

          <div id="community-why" class="subgroup">
            <h4>What’s a Copilot community?</h4>
            <p>
              Educators using Copilot typically organize themselves onto
              “projects.” However, sometimes an instructional leader, coach, or
              school or district administrator may want to group several
              projects together into a “community” so that they can monitor and
              support progress across all of them. For example, say that
              twenty-four teachers at the same middle school are all using
              Copilot. They form three separate projects of eight teachers
              &mdash; one corresponding to each grade level. If an
              instructional leader or coach would like to track progress across
              all three projects, the best way to do that would be to group
              those projects into a community.
