<!-- THE GOAL -->
<div class="section">
  <h2 id="goal">The Goal: Support Students, Improve Outcomes</h2>
  <p>Well-designed learning environments can help students make sense of challenges in ways that bolster academic performance and foster well-being. Research shows that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Students&rsquo; experiences of their learning environments can critically affect their academic outcomes</li>
    <li>Learning environments attuned to students&rsquo; experiences can help more students persist through challenges</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- UNDERSTAND -->
<div class="section color3">
  <h2 id="understand">Understand Students&rsquo; Experiences</h2>
  <p>The Survey of Student Experiences (SSE) is a free, easy-to-use tool that helps colleges and universities better understand how their undergraduate students experience their campus learning environments and strategically adopt evidence-based resources to help more students succeed, particularly those from backgrounds traditionally disadvantaged in higher education.</p>

  <h3 id="how">The Survey of Student Experiences helps institutions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Better understand their students&rsquo; experiences, focusing on pivotal moments and beliefs that can affect well-being, levels of engagement, and academic outcomes</li>
    <li>Identify areas in which their students may benefit from additional support</li>
    <li>Select the most relevant evidence-based resources to help motivate and support their students</li>
  </ul>
