<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<div class="section">

    <p>
      New Teacher Center (NTC), EDENS Lab, and PERTS are collaborating on a
      pilot program to provide support for building empathy in student-teacher
      relationships. Research shows that student-teacher relationships are
      important for student success. In a recent peer-reviewed study, suspension
      rates dropped by 50% in the classes of teachers who completed a 60-minute
      training about the importance of supportive student-teacher relationships
      (Okonofua, Paunesku, & Walton, 2016; see also &ldquo;<a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/02/opinion/sunday/dont-suspend-students-empathize.html"
        >Don&rsquo;t Suspend Students. Empathize.</a
      >&rdquo;) These dramatic results underscore what many teachers know and
      what research has shown time and again: students engage and learn best
      when they feel trusted, respected, and valued by their teachers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Classroom Connections Program (CCP) is a data-driven professional
      learning experience designed to help teachers build strong, empathic
      relationships that provide students with the trust, respect, and
      psychological safety that are essential to academic engagement and
      success. The CCP includes an empathic mindset training developed by Dr.
      Jason Okonofua and colleagues. The training will be delivered in the
      context of the New Teacher Center's proven coaching model, giving teachers
      the support they need to adapt the empathic teaching strategies with their
      own students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the PERTS Copilot platform will provide teachers and coaches with
      rapid formative feedback about the effects of the training on studentsâ€™
      classroom experiences, relationships, and engagement. Teachers will work
      with coaches to complete online lessons and implement three improvement
      cycles, each including brief student surveys, collaborative
      reflection/planning with coaches during meetings, implementation of plans,
      coach observation, and refinement. We anticipate these activities will be
      highly valuable to instruction and in providing data-driven guidance to
      the field.
