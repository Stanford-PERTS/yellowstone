<h3>Students' PATHS Study</h3>

<p>
    People have different reasons for doing things, and they learn differently.
    We would like to learn more about your experiences and motivations.  Your
    answers will be used to inform programs for young people like yourself.
</p>
<p>
    Completing this online program is voluntary and your grade in this class
    will not be affected.  Try to complete all of the activities and questions.
    If you do not want to complete an activity or answer a question, you may
    skip it.  You also may stop participating at any time.  There are no wrong
    answers and you will not receive a grade based on your performance on these
    activities.
</p>
<p>
    Your participation is confidential and no information about you or your
    school will be identified in any published report.  Responses and results
    are private, and your teacher will not have access to the answers you give.
</p>
<p>
    Please complete this online activity by yourself, without the assistance of
    teachers, classmates, or others.  Please be honest as you answer
    questions&mdash;it's important that we hear exactly what itâ€™s like for you
    as a student. When you are finished, follow the instructions of the person
    leading the study activity.
</p>
<p>
    Thank you very much for your help.
