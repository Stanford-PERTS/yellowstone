              'of my classes were so big; I thought it didn’t matter if I didn’t show ' +
              'up. I started skipping classes to hang out with friends from my dorm, ' +
              'play ultimate frisbee at Schenley Park, or just sleep in. I felt like ' +
              'I could do whatever I wanted. But soon I started falling behind in ' +
              'my classes and missing important course material, which made studying ' +
              'for tests more difficult. My big wake-up call came when I got back ' +
              'my midterm grades and saw how poorly I had done. I started to think ' +
              'that maybe I wasn’t cut out for college. But I contacted an academic ' +
              'advisor for help and he told me that many students struggle to balance ' +
              'their studies with their social lives, especially when they first get ' +
              'to college. To be successful, students need to learn to manage their ' +
              'time more effectively. So, I began to prioritize going to class and ' +
              'keeping up with readings, which made studying for tests less difficult. ' +
              'Eventually, I was able to bring my grades back up, while still having ' +
              'time to enjoy the freedom and independence that comes with college ' +

              'out on making friends. Toward the end of fall semester I found a job ' +
              'on campus. That made finances easier. But what made the biggest difference ' +
              'was getting to know other students better. I was starting to spend ' +
              'more time with a group of guys from my hall. As I got to know them ' +
              'better, I felt more comfortable being honest about my budget. In general, ' +

              'of students with more money. But at the end of the day, a big part ' +
              'of college is really getting to know people. And that works best when ' +
              'you’re honest about who you are and where you come from. I’ve found ' +

          '<p>One of my biggest worries about coming to a commuter school was making ' +
              'friends. At first, I wasn’t sure how to meet people, so I kept to myself. ' +
              'Even though there were a lot of people around, I felt pretty lonely ' +
              'sometimes. I got into a routine where I would just come to campus, ' +
              'go to my classes, and leave right after. But I wanted to be more involved, ' +
              'so I decided to be more proactive. I started to get to campus early ' +
              'to eat lunch and made it a point to study on campus after class. I ' +
              'was surprised by how many people were around and I started talking ' +
              'with the people I’d see over and over at the union. Some of the guys ' +
              'and I even joined a club together. As I got more comfortable, I found ' +
              'myself making friends in other ways, too, like when I joined a study ' +
              'group with some people from my pre-calc class. I realized that most ' +
              'people here are really friendly, and that many are just as nervous ' +
              'as I was about making friends. There’s a community at DH. Once I reached ' +

          '<p>When I transferred to DH, my primary concern was finishing my degree to ' +
              'make a better life for my family. The social aspect of college seemed ' +
              'unnecessary, but it turned out to be more important than I thought. ' +
              'One day stands out in particular. My childcare fell through so I had ' +
              'to take my son to the library while I tried to finish a paper. I only ' +
              'needed about 10 more minutes, but he was fussy and started crying. ' +
              'I tried to calm him down, but nothing was working. I was at my breaking ' +
              'point. But then, another student asked to show my son a kid’s book ' +
              'she had in her bag. She sat down with him and pointed out the funny ' +
              'pictures and my son stopped crying. He was engaged with the story and ' +
              'I was able to finish writing. Afterwards, I learned that she has a ' +
              'daughter about my son’s age and also found it tough to juggle school ' +
              'and family. Over time, I’ve realized that many people can relate to ' +
              'my experiences and friends like her are really important to my academic ' +

              'to college my whole life and, since I’m the first one, it was a big ' +
              'deal. Still, I knew it’d be difficult. Early on, I struggled balancing ' +
              'work, school, and family. Even though I was working 3 jobs and taking ' +
              '18 credits, my family didn’t understand why I couldn’t be around more. ' +
              'I felt guilty when I had to go to the library because it was too loud ' +
              'to study at home. After bombing a biology exam, I wondered whether ' +
              'college was really for me. But I didn’t want to let myself or my family ' +
              'down, so I worked up the courage to get help by talking to my professor. ' +
              'She told me that plenty of other students struggle too, but certain ' +
              'strategies could make things easier. We walked through the things I ' +
              'didn’t understand, and she helped me figure out more efficient ways ' +
              'to study. She and I also discussed ways to talk with my family. When ' +
              'I got home we made a deal that I would study at school for a certain ' +

              'the most difficult part was coming from a situation in which ' +
              'I knew every student in school for the past seven years to ' +
              'college where I didn’t know one student yet. Once I got here, ' +

              'to work to find lab partners and people to be in study groups ' +
              'with. I missed home often, and I had to remind myself that ' +
              'making close friends takes time. But over time, in classes, ' +
              'clubs, and social activities, I have met other people, some ' +
              'of whom are now just as close as my friends in high school ' +

          '<p>I have really enjoyed my time at SOU. But it hasn&rsquo;t always ' +
              'been smooth sailing. Balancing finances and work with school ' +
              'was challenging for me. Especially in the beginning, I worked ' +
              'so many late hours that my grades suffered. I felt I was the ' +
              'only one struggling. But, of course that wasn&rsquo;t the case. ' +
              'When I got a job as an RA in the dorms, it gave me more flexible ' +
              'work hours and I saw that many students struggle with these ' +
              'same issues. Later on, new students on my floor would come ' +
              'to me with their concerns, and I would share with them ways ' +
              'that I learned to deal with financial stress. Since I&rsquo;ve ' +
              'started school, I&rsquo;ve learned to be more proactive. Now, ' +

              'was hard because it seemed like everyone else was so stoked ' +
              'to be away. For me, what has helped most is talking with my ' +

              'were mostly about things going on at home, but as I have made ' +

              'the course load with family and work has been a big challenge. ' +
              'Childcare is difficult to sort out and housing in Ashland is ' +

              'I was concerned that in my classes, I wouldn&rsquo;t fit in ' +
              'because of my age. Professors just seemed easier to connect ' +
              'with. However, in one of my classes, we had a group project ' +
              'and I worried that the other students in my group would dismiss ' +
              'me as the "old guy." But instead, they were really kind and ' +
              'accepting--they even worked around my child care challenges ' +
              'to meet when I was available. Even when people&rsquo;s backgrounds ' +
              'are quite different, people here take the time to get to know ' +

              'I just felt up in the air. I was pretty homesick, and I had to remind ' +
              'myself that making close friends takes time. Eventually I began having ' +
              'lunch with this group of guys, and we did other stuff together, too, ' +
              'like play video games. It was a little thing, but it was fun, it made ' +
              'me feel less isolated, and sometimes it was even helpful. One of the ' +
              'guys told me about an awesome class he’d taken. I took another class ' +
              'with that same professor, and he was great. He was really generous ' +
              'with his time during office hours and he helped me decide what to major ' +
              'in. That was three years ago. Now some of those guys are my close friends. ' +
              'We’ve gone through college together, and we’ve helped each other along ' +

              'at DePauw. Sometimes early on, I felt pressure to go to movies and ' +
              'out to eat when I didn’t have the money and couldn’t afford it. I worried ' +
              'that if I didn’t participate people might judge me or that I’d miss ' +
              'out on making friends. Toward the end of fall semester I found a job ' +
              'on campus. That made finances easier. But what made the biggest difference ' +
              'was getting to know other students better. I was starting to spend ' +
              'more time with a group of guys from my hall. As I got to know them ' +
              'better, I felt more comfortable being honest about my budget. In general, ' +
              'they were really understanding. A few were even feeling the same way. ' +
              'Now we make more of an effort to do things everyone can afford. It’s ' +
              'brought us closer and led us into some fun adventures because we’ve ' +
              'had to be more creative sometimes. Looking back, I realize that, of ' +
              'course, my experience is going to be different from the experiences ' +
              'of students with more money. But at the end of the day, a big part ' +
              'of college is really getting to know people. And that works best when ' +
              'you’re honest about who you are and where you come from. I’ve found ' +
              'that, for the most part, people are receptive to that. For me, that’s ' +

            'But I was anxious too—it’s a big transition. For me the most difficult ' +
            'part was coming from a situation in which I knew every student ' +
            'for the past seven years to college where I didn’t know one student ' +
            'yet. Once I got here, even though I met large numbers of people, ' +
            'I didn’t have a small group of close friends. At first sometimes ' +
            'I had to work to find lab partners and people to be in study groups ' +
            'with. Sometimes I just felt up in the air. I was pretty homesick, ' +
            'and I had to remind myself that making close friends takes time. ' +
            'Eventually I began having lunch with this group of guys, and we ' +
            'did other stuff together, too, like play video games. It was a ' +
            'little thing, but it was fun, it made me feel less isolated, and ' +
            'sometimes it was even helpful. One of the guys told me about an ' +
            'awesome class he’d taken. I took another class with that same professor, ' +
            'and he was great. He was really generous with his time during office ' +
            'hours and he helped me decide what to major in. That was three ' +
            'years ago. Now some of those guys are my close friends. We’ve gone ' +

            'at Allegheny. Sometimes early on, I felt pressure to go to movies ' +
            'and out to eat when I didn’t have the money and couldn’t afford ' +
            'it. I worried that if I didn’t participate people might judge me ' +
            'or that I’d miss out on making friends. Toward the end of fall ' +
            'semester I found a job on campus. That made finances easier. But ' +
            'what made the biggest difference was getting to know other students ' +

              'are eager to work with students on subjects they love. Later, I ended ' +
